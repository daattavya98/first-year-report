This is perhaps counter-intuitive since mathematical sciences require the rigorous definitions, derivations, and proofs, in contrast to the experimental sciences which rely on the modelling of data with error-bars. In this Perspective, we categorize the approaches to mathematical discovery as “top-down”, “bottom-up” and “meta-mathematics”, as inspired by historical examples. We review some of the progress over the last few years, comparing and contrasting both the advances and the short-comings in each approach. We argue that while the theorist is in no way in danger of being replaced by AI in the near future, the hybrid of human expertise and AI algorithms will become an integral part of theoretical discovery.},

Theorems 2.1 and 2.3, respectively, provide characterizations of O-minimal ordered groups and rings. Several other simple results are collected in \${\textbackslash}S3\$. The primary tool in the analysis of O-minimal structures is a strong analogue of "forking symmetry," given by Theorem 4.2. This result states that any (parametrically) definable unary function in an O-minimal structure is piecewise either constant or an order-preserving or reversing bijection of intervals. The results that follow include the existence and uniqueness of prime models over sets (Theorem 5.1) and a characterization of all {$\aleph$}0-categorical O-minimal structures (Theorem 6.1).},

The decidability of Th(R , + , .) is a nice result in its own right and quite useful in many theoretical decidability questions but has otherwise not been important in settling open problems. Th(R , + , .·)= theory of real closed fields is useful in proving properties of real closed fields: in certain cases the only known proof consists of first establishing the property for the field of reals by transcendental methods and then invoking elimination of quantifiers for (R , <,0, 1, +, .·). This is called Tarski's Principle.}

A tame function or space can only have a finite amount of structure, in a precise sense which we explain. Tameness generalizes the notion of an analytic function to include certain non-analytic limits, and we show that this includes many limits which are known to arise in physics. For renormalizable quantum field theories, we give a general proof that amplitudes at each order in the loop expansion are tame functions of the external momenta and the couplings. We then consider a variety of exact non-perturbative results and show that they are tame but only given constraints on the UV definition of the theory. This provides further evidence for the recent conjecture of the second author that all effective theories that can be coupled to quantum gravity are tame. We also discuss whether renormalization group flow is tame, and comment on the applicability of our results to effective theories.},

We then apply this methodology to a variety of physical systems and derive the complexity of parameter-dependent physical observables and coupling functions appearing in effective Lagrangians. In order to implement these ideas, it is essential to consider physical theories that can be defined in an o-minimal structure. O-minimality, a concept from mathematical logic, encapsulates a tameness principle. It was recently argued that this property is inherent to many known quantum field theories and is linked to the UV completion of the theory. To assign a complexity to each statement in these theories one has to further constrain the allowed o-minimal structures. To exemplify this, we show that many physical systems can be formulated using Pfaffian o-minimal structures, which have a well-established notion of complexity. More generally, we propose adopting sharply o-minimal structures, recently introduced by Binyamini and Novikov, as an overarching framework to measure complexity in quantum theories.},

Subsequently, in order to address finer details of the locus of flux vacua, we propose three mathematically precise conjectures on the expected number of connected components, geometric complexity, and dimensionality of the vacuum locus. With the recent breakthroughs on the tameness of Hodge theory, we believe that they are attainable to rigorous mathematical tools and can be successfully addressed in the near future. The remainder of the paper is concerned with more technical aspects of the finiteness theorems. In particular, we investigate their local implications and explain how infinite tails of disconnected vacua approaching the boundaries of the moduli space are forbidden. To make this precise, we present new results on asymptotic expansions of Hodge inner products near arbitrary boundaries of the complex structure moduli space.},

We argue that the inherent path-dependence of this statement can be addressed when combining the Distance Conjecture with the recent Tameness Conjecture. The latter asserts that effective theories are described by tame geometry and implements strong finiteness constraints on coupling functions and field spaces. By exploiting these tameness constraints we argue that the region near the infinite distance point admits a decomposition into finitely many sectors in which path-independent statements for the associated towers of states can be established. We then introduce a more constrained class of tame functions with at most polynomial asymptotic growth and argue that they suffice to describe the known string theory effective actions. Remarkably, the multi-field dependence of such functions can be reconstructed by one-dimensional linear test paths in each sector near the boundary. In four-dimensional effective theories, these test paths are traced out as a discrete set of cosmic string solutions. This indicates that such cosmic string solutions can serve as powerful tool to study the near-boundary field space region of any four-dimensional effective field theory. To illustrate these general observations we discuss the central role of tameness and cosmic string solutions in Calabi-Yau compactifications of Type IIB string theory.},

But this program contains several other important ideas. In particular, motivated by surface topology and moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces, Grothendieck calls there for a recasting of topology, in order to make it fit to the objects of semialgebraic and semianalytic geometry, and in particular to the study of the Mumford-Deligne compactifications of moduli spaces. A new conception of manifold, of submanifold and of maps between them is outlined. We review these ideas in the present chapter, because of their relation to the theory of moduli and Te-ichm\{{\textbackslash}"u\}ller spaces. We also mention briefly the relations between Grothendieck's ideas and earlier theories developed by Whitney, Lojasiewicz and Hironaka and especially Thom, and with the more recent theory of o-minimal structures.

  abstract = {Alexander Grothendieck suggested creating a new branch of topology, called ``topologie mod{\'e}r{\'e}e''. In a paper by N. A'Campo, L. Ji, and A. Papadopoulos the authors conclude that no such tame topology has been developed at a purely topological level. We see our theory of sets with distinguished families of subsets, which we call smopologies, as realising Grothendieck's idea and the demands of the mentioned paper. Dropping the requirement of stability under infinite unions makes it possible to obtain several equivalences of categories of spaces with categories of lattices. We show several variations in Stone duality and Esakia duality for categories of small or locally small spaces and some subclasses of strictly continuous (or bouned continuous) mappings. Such equivalences are better than the spectral reflector functor for usual topological spaces. Some spectralifications of Kolmogorov locally small spaces can be obtained by Stone duality. Small spaces or locally small spaces seem to be generalised topological spaces. However, looking at them as topological spaces with an additional structure is better. The language of smopologies and bounded continuous mappings simplifies the language of certain Grothendieck sites and permits us to glue together infinite families of definable sets in structures with topologies, which was important when developing the o-minimal homotopy theory.},

            SymPy is an open source computer algebra system written in pure Python. It is built with a focus on extensibility and ease of use, through both interactive and programmatic applications. These characteristics have led SymPy to become a popular symbolic library for the scientific Python ecosystem. This paper presents the architecture of SymPy, a description of its features, and a discussion of select submodules. The supplementary material provide additional examples and further outline details of the architecture and features of SymPy.
